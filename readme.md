## Development

Marvin's requirements are listed in package.json **engines**. Generally the
latest Node.js active LTS version, and npm > 5.X should do it.

For running the project on development, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
That will run the server in development mode with file watching which will auto
restart the server when files change.
